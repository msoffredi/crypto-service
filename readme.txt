Assumptions

1. Input numbers are within Java int data type (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)

Decisions

1. Leave deviation output as a standard Java double data type. It could be formatted into a fixed number of decimals later.
2. Keeping API endpoints simple for the sake of time (following API Names on requirements)
3. Output will be a JSON object
4. API will be a standard REST API
